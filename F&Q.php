                            The most budget-friendly time of the year for cruises is usually in late summer and fall.
                            Cruise prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, which is why they are higher during
                            holidays and school breaks. If you're seeking a good deal but prefer not to travel in late
                            summer or fall, consider cruising during these non-peak periods:

                            Most guests bring $50-$120 in cash per day to spend during their cruise. This allows for the

                            treatments. While you can charge these expenses to your shipboard account or use a debit or
                            credit card for "in port" purchases, carrying cash is advisable for smaller transactions
                            when off the ship.

                            When exploring destinations while in port, cash is useful for transportation, tips, gifts,

                            It's recommended to carry all daily medications in your hand luggage in case of delays or
                            emergencies. Ensure you bring an adequate supply, as certain medications may not be

                            Prescription medication can be placed in a traveling pill case for convenience. While
                            the TSA doesn't require medication to be in its original prescription bottle, having the
                            original packaging with dosage, strength, and doctor information can be helpful if
                            questioned.<br><br />
                            Over-the-counter medications that you might need should be packed in their
                            original packages. This includes medicine for headaches, nausea, upset stomach, muscle rubs,
                            heartburn, and sunburn treatments.
